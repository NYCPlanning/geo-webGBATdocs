A list of expected field values and their meaning accompanies\nthe definitions.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Valid B7SC/Street Name:\n\n\nIdentifies additional local group of street names at the given location.\n\n\n\n\nAddress Point ID:\n\n\nThe Address Point ID is a unique nine digit identifier for each address point.\nAddress Points are items in a CSCL feature class that represent point locations\n(approximately five feet inside a building (identified by BIN)) along the\ncorresponding street frontage. Initially these were based on DCP\ns Property\nAddress Directory (PAD). Please note that whereas addresses in PAD reflect an\nadministrative address range for a building, the Address Points usually only\nreflect the posted address. For example, PAD shows 14 \n 32 Reade Street as the\naddress for DCP\ns former headquarters. The Address Point only shows 22 \n 22\nReade Street (the posted address).\n\n\n\n\nAddress Range List:\n\n\nAn input address number is often part of a larger address range that is valid\nfor a tax lot. A location may also have additional address ranges on street\nnames that differ from the input, particularly when the input address is located\non a corner lot or a through lot. The address range list includes the Address\nType, Low and High Address Numbers, Street Name, BIN and TPAD BIN Status.\n\n\n\n\nAddress Type:\n\n\nVarious geographic identifiers related to the property functions in Geosupport\n(1B, BL, BN).\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \nValue \n\n    \nDescription\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nblank\n\n    \nAddress Range\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nA\n\n    \nAddressable Place Name\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nB\n\n    \nNon-Addressable Unnamed Building\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nF\n\n    \nVacant Street Frontage\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nG\n\n    \nName of NAP Complex\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nH\n\n    \nHyphenated Address Range\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nM\n\n    \nMixed Hyphenation Address Range\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nN\n\n    \nNon-Addressable Place Name\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nO\n\n    \nOut of Sequence Address\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nQ\n\n    \nPseudo Address\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nR\n\n    \nReal Address for Vanity Address\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nT\n\n    \nBridge/Tunnel\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nU\n\n    \nSubway - Railway Station\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nV\n\n    \nVanity Address\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nW\n\n    \nNon-Addressable Building Frontage\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nX\n\n    \nConstituent NAP of Complex\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlley/Cross Street Flag:\n\n\nThis indicates if the cross streets returned have been modified.\n\n\nXStrts Changed\n\n\nNo Split/Change\n\n\n\n\nAssembly District:\n\n\nNew York State Assembly District.

'Minimal'\nmeans the polygon is not subdivided by other segments into a smaller polygon.\nAtomic Polygon numbers are unique within 2010 Census Tracts and are used as\nbuilding blocks for many higher geographies.\n\n\n\n\nAuxiliary Segment Count:\n\n\nRepresents the number of segments that were combined to create a generated\nrecord.\n\n\n\n\nAuxiliary Segment ID List:\n\n\nList of Segment ID's associated with a generated record.\n\n\n\n\nB5SC, B7SC, B10SC (Street Codes):\n\n\nNumeric street codes are assigned to represent the city\ns street names and other\ngeographic feature names. A borough code combined with a 5-digit street code\n(B5SC) corresponds to the primary name for a given piece of geography and\nencodes the alias relationships between street names. A borough code combined\nwith a 7-digit street code (B7SC) corresponds to the preferred name for a\nspecific location on a street whereas a 10-digit street code (B10SC) corresponds\nto a specific spelling of a specific street name in the given borough.\n\n\n\n\nBBL (Borough, Block, Lot):\n\n\nIdentifies a parcel of real property in New York City, called a tax lot. The BBL\ncontains a 1 byte Borough Code, a 5-byte Tax Block, and a 4-byte tax lot. The\ntax block and tax lot are both right justified, zero filled.\n\n\nIn a condominium, each condominium unit is a separate tax lot and has its own\nBBL. WebGBAT will return both the low and high BBL associated with the condo. Users\nshould also note than if a condo lot is entered as input into a Block \n Lot\n(Function BL), the tax lot returned in WebGBAT is a Billing BBL, generally\nassociated with the management company for the condo instead of an individual\nowner.\n\n\n\n\nBike Lane:\n\n\nDefines which street segments are part of the bicycle network as defined by the\nDepartment of Transportation.\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \nValue\n\n    \nDescription\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n1 Class I:\n\n    \nSeparated Greenway\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n2 Class II:\n\n    \nStriped Bike Lane\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n3 Class III:\n\n    \nSigned Bicycle Route\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n4 Links:\n\n    \nConnecting Segments\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n5 Class I, II:\n\n    \nCombination of Class I and II\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n6 Class II, III:\n\n    \nCombination of Class II and III\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n7 Stairs:\n\n    \nStep streets, bridge stairs, etc.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n8 Class I, III:\n\n    \nCombination of Class I and III (Class I with segment and Class III against)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n9 Class II, I:\n\n    \nCombination of Class II and I (Class II with segment and Class I against)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n10 Class III, I:\n\n    \nCombination of Class III and I (Class III with segment and Class I against)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n11 Class III, II:\n\n    \nCombination of Class III and II (Class III with segment and Class II against)\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nBike Lane Traffic Direction:\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \nFT\n\n    \nWith\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nTF\n\n    \nAgainst\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nTW\n\n    \nTwo-Way\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nNV\n\n    \nNon-Vehicular\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nBIN:\n\n\nBuilding Identification Number (BIN) is a seven-digit numerical identifier\nunique to each building in the City of New York. The first digit is the Borough\nCode. If the borough code is followed by all zeroes (commonly referred to as a\n\nmillion BIN\n, this indicates that a BIN has not been assigned, either because\nthe address associated with the building has not yet been built, an address is\nassigned as a potential valid range where there is no building (vacant lot or\nvacant street frontage), or it is associated with a constituent entity of a\nComplex NAP but does not indicate a building or structure that would have a BIN\nassignment (such as the Children\ns Zoo Spider Web within Central Park).\n\n\n\n\nBIN Status:\n See \nTPAD BIN Status\n\n\n\n\nBlock Face:\n\n\nA block face is generally described as one side of a street between two\nconsecutive intersections, or one side a city block. This field returns the\nnumber of block faces that border the tax lot.\n\n\n\n\nBlock Face ID:\n\n\nLeft Blockface ID is a ten digit number identifying the block face on the left\nhand side of a segment. Correspondingly, Right Blockface ID identifies the block\nface on the right hand side of a segment. Block Face is defined as one\ncontinuous side of a physical block that is intersected on that side by two\nother physical through streets. Blockface IDs were established by DoITT\ns\nconsultants working on the planimetric feature classes for NYC and are not\nmaintained by the Department of City Planning.\n\n\n\n\nBOE Preferred B7SC / Street Name:\n\n\nIdentifies the local group of street names used by the Board of Elections as\n'preferred' for a specific location on a street.

In the case of Function 3 (Street\nSegment), the compass direction may be set to indicate the side of the street to\nbe processed. The compass direction can also be indicated on Function 3S (Street\nStretch) for one or both of the cross streets if they intersect at two distinct\nlocations.\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \nValue\n\n    \nDescription\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nE\n\n    \nEast\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nN\n\n    \nNorth\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nS\n\n    \nSouth\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nW\n\n    \nWest\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorner Code:\n\n\nIndicates if the input is located on a corner property of the physical block.\n\n\n\n\nCross Street:\n\n\nA street intersecting another street. In WebGBAT, Cross Streets used as input for a\nstreet segment (Function 3) must be consecutive. WebGBAT also returns cross streets\nat the low and high address ends of street segments.\n\n\n\n\nCross Street Count:\n\n\nThe number of streets that intersect at this intersection.\n\n\n\n\nCurve Flag:\n\n\nThis flag indicates whether the given geographic feature segment is in reality\ncurved. If so, the curve may be an arc of a circle or an irregular curve. When\nthe segment specified by the input data is an arc of a circle, Functions 1 and\n1E return Spatial Coordinates that are positioned relative to this arc rather\nthan to the segment\ns chord (the imaginary straight line joining the curved\nfeature\ns endpoints). When the segment specified by the input data is an\nirregular curve, Functions 1 and 1E return blanks in the Spatial Coordinate\nfields (q.v.), and issue a warning with Reason Code value \nP\n. In the case of\nFunctions 3 and 3C, if the input data define a street stretch encompassing more\nthan one segment (because of a T-intersection or bend), the Curve Flag is set\n\non\n (non-blank) if at least one of the constituent segments of the stretch is\ncurved.

Users have a choice of two formats for\nnormalizing street names, called the compact and sort formats. The sort format includes\nspacing to allow the proper sorting of numerical street names for reporting purposes,\nand compact removes the spaces.

A complete list of Geosupport (the software behind GOAT) Return\nCodes (GRCs) and Reason Codes can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nIf an inquiry is rejected and you wish to modify your input data and re-submit the\ninquiry, or if you wish to submit another inquiry using the same function, simply\ntype over your previous data entries as needed and then press the Submit button.\nRemember to change the borough if necessary.\n\n\nIf an inquiry is rejected and you believe the input to be valid, you may send feedback\nby clicking on the \nSend Feedback\n link. Please note that you may also\nsend feedback when your inquiry is not rejected.\n\n\nThe glossary may be accessed by clicking on any of the label names in the output\nor by clicking \nhere\n.\n\n\nTips for Efficient Data Entry of Street Names\n\n\nTo minimize typing when entering street names, take advantage of the following features\navailable with all GOAT functions:\n\n\nStreet directional and street type words may be entered in abbreviated form, such\nas ST for STREET, AV or AVE for AVENUE, E for EAST, BL or BLVD for BOULEVARD. For\nexample, READE STREET may be entered as READE ST. In general, abbreviations that\nwould be recognizable to a person are also recognizable to GOAT.\n\n\nIf the street name being entered has a word containing numeric digits, you need\nnot enter the ordinal suffix (the characters 'st', 'nd', 'rd' or 'th' that can follow\na numeric value). For example, WEST 23RD STREET may be entered as W 23 ST.\n\n\nYou may enter partial street names when they are unambiguous in a borough. For example,\nin the borough of Queens, GOAT recognizes MADISON as a partial name for MADISON\nSTREET, since this is the only valid full name that begins with MADISON. However,\nin Manhattan, MADISON is ambiguous and is not accepted as an input street name,\nsince both MADISON AVENUE and MADISON STREET are valid full names.\n\n\nGOAT has three features to assist you with spelling street names and place names:\n\n\nAs you start to type, GOAT will pre-populate a dropdown list based on your entry.\nFor example, if you start to type \nBroadway\n, 10 names beginning with\n\nB\n will appear. As you enter \nBR\n, the 10 names change\nto entries beginning with \nBR\n. And as you type \nBRO\n, another\n10 names will appear. At this point, \nBROADWAY\n will appear in the list\nand you may select the name from the dropdown list or continue typing it in as you\nchoose.\n\n\nIf you are not sure how to spell a name, you can also use the STREET (Name / Code)\nfunction and select an option to \nBrowse Street Name Dictionary\n to\nsearch through an alphabetical list of all the names that GOAT recognizes as valid.\n\n\nFinally, if GOAT rejects a name that you have entered, the message will sometimes\nlist one or more valid names that GOAT considers to be similar to the rejected input\nname. These are suggestions only; your intended name may not be any of these names.\nIf you do recognize a similar name as your intended name, you may correct your input\nname by clicking on the appropriate \nCopy to\n (input field) and re-submitting\nyour inquiry.\n\n\nGOAT accepts the pseudo-street names BEND, DEAD END and CITY LIMIT as input street\nnames under certain circumstances. They may not serve as input names for ADDRESS\n(Function 1B), but may serve as input names to INTERSECTION (Function 2). For STREET\nSEGMENT (Functions 3) and STREET STRETCH (Function 3S), they may serve as input\ncross street names only, not as the input 'on' street name.\n\n\nReturn to Menu\n\n\n\n\nADDRESS Help:\n\n\nThis screen allows for two options.  A user can choose to\n\u201cDisplay Street and Property Information\u201d or \u201cDisplay Address Point Information.\n\n\n1. Display Street and Property Information (Function 1B)\n\n\nThe input data for Function 1B is an address or a place name. Two sets of geographic\ninformation are returned; political geography associated with the entire block face\ncontaining the input location, followed by property level and building specific\noutput.\n\n\nThe acceptance of an address by Function 1B does not necessarily signify that an\nactual building exists having that address. You must check both sets of output.\nThe geographic and political information returned in the upper portions of the output\nscreen are related to an address range along a street block face. The information\ntoward the bottom of the screen is property-level specific. An address range along\na street block typically encompasses all possible addresses that could be assigned,\nsuch as 2 \n 98 (on the even side of the street). However, in reality, there\nmay only be buildings with the addresses 10, 34 and 76. Thus if another address\nwithin that range is entered, it will get a \nhit\n on the street level\ninformation, but not on the property level information.\n\n\nIf property level information is returned, it generally signifies that an actual\nbuilding exists having that address. However, the user should pay particular attention\nto the \nType\n column included in the Address Range List at the bottom\nof the screen to see if an address is listed as a \nPseudo Address'. \nPseudo\nAddresses' are addresses assigned by the Department of City Planning to some vacant\nstreet frontages to enable a property to be accessed. These addresses have no \nofficial'\nstatus and should never be used outside of this system.\n\n\nIn addition to the \nfixed' data returned, you have a choice of receiving a\nlist of addresses which applies to the property and/or a list of BINs (Building\nIdentification Numbers) that reside on the property identified by the input address.\nYou may also elect to receive BIN information related to the Transitional PAD file\n(TPAD), and Roadbed Specific Information pertaining to the street level data. The\ninput street name may also be normalized in a variety of ways (see Street (Name\n/ Code) Help for more information.\n\n\nInstructions for Entering Function 1B Input Data:\n\n\nAs input data to Function 1B, you may enter an address, consisting of an address\nnumber and a street name or an address number and a place name; or you may enter\na place name alone without an address number.\n\n\nSome place names serve as street names in that they combine with address numbers\nto form addresses. Some examples recognized by GOAT are: in Manhattan, CONFUCIUS\nPLAZA, PENN PLAZA and WASHINGTON SQUARE VILLAGE; in the Bronx, BRONX TERMINAL MARKET\nand FORDHAM PLAZA; in Brooklyn, METROTECH and FORT HAMILTON MANOR; and in Queens,\nASTORIA SQUARE. To make a Function 1B inquiry for 2 Penn Plaza, for example, select\nManhattan as the borough, enter 2 in the Address Number box, enter PENN PLAZA in\nthe Street or Place Name box and press the Submit button.\n\n\nMost place names do not combine with address numbers to form addresses, but rather,\nidentify specific places by themselves. Some typical examples recognized by GOAT\nare EMPIRE STATE BUILDING, CARNEGIE HALL, CITI FIELD, LA GUARDIA AIRPORT. To make\na Function 1B inquiry for a place name without an address number, first select the\nborough, make sure the Address Number box is blank, and then enter the place name\nin the Street or Place Name box. For example, to process EMPIRE STATE BUILDING,\nselect Manhattan as the borough, make sure that the Address Number box is empty,\nand enter EMPIRE STATE BUILDING in the Street or Place Name box, and press the Submit\nbutton.\n\n\nWhen entering an address number that normally contains a hyphen, such as most address\nnumbers in Queens and a few address numbers in other boroughs, it is advisable to\ninclude the hyphen.\n\n\nWhen entering an address number for the Edgewater Park neighborhood of the Bronx,\nmake sure to include the proper section letter \nsuffix\n after the numeric\naddress number (for example, 7A Edgewater Park). Valid suffixes for Edgewater Park\nare A, B, C, D and E.\n\n\nIf you select \nComplete BIN List', you will receive a list of BINs as part\nof your output. If you do not select \nBIN List', you will receive a list of\nup to twenty one addresses which apply to the property. For some properties, there\nare more than twenty one addresses. In these situations, in addition to the twenty\none addresses starting with your input address, you will receive a warning message\nindicating that the lot has more addresses than are displayed.\n\n\nThe TPAD (Transitional Property Address Directory) option allows you to get up-to-date\nproperty related information. The TPAD file is updated daily with new information\nreceived from the Department of Buildings regarding job filings for new buildings\nand demolition jobs. Information regarding activity and status is returned.\n\n\nThe Roadbed Specific Information option will return roadbed-specific geocodes, assuming\nthat the input street has multiple roadbeds. Examples of geocodes that would be\ndifferent include Segment ID, Physical ID, Segment Type, and X,Y coordinates. Some\nCity Service Information may vary as well.\n\n\n2. Display Address Point Information (Function AP)\n\n\nFunction AP returns Address Point information and some property level information of a\ngiven input address (house number and street name \u2013 there are no NAPs).  Returned items\nare the Address Point ID and X, Y coordinates of the Address Point.  Property level\ninformation such as the Borough-Block-Lot (BBL) of the input address are also returned.  \n\n\nInstruction for Entering Function AP Input Data:\n\n\nAs input data to Function AP, you may enter an address, consisting of an address number\nand a street name.  Non-Addressable-Placenames (NAPs) are not allowed.  \n\n\nReturn to Menu\n\n\n\n\nINTERSECTION (Function 2) Help:\n\n\nThe input data to INTERSECTION (Function 2) is a street intersection. Function 2\nreturns geographic information related to the intersection, including the names\nof any additional streets that are at the intersection, and the administrative and\npolitical district identifiers within which the intersection is located. If an intersection\nlies on a boundary of two or more districts of a particular type, only one of those\ndistricts is listed.\n\n\nInstructions for Entering Function 2 Input Data:\n\n\nThe INTERSECTION tab in the GOAT application offers two input options:\n\n\n\nCheck \"Enter Node ID\" and enter a NODE ID in the NODE ID text box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncheck \"Enter Node ID\" and follow the instructions below.\n\n\nSelect the Borough of Street 1 or Intersection Name. GOAT automatically modifies\nthe Borough of Street 2 to coincide with the Borough of Street 1 or Intersection\nName. Enter the names of two streets at the intersection, in either order, in the\nboxes labeled Street 1 or Intersection Name and Street 2. If there are more than\ntwo streets at the intersection, you may identify the intersection by entering any\npair of those streets. Except for three special cases discussed below, you may now\nsubmit your inquiry by pressing the Submit button or the ENTER key.\n\n\nSpecial case 1: If the intersection you are submitting lies on a borough boundary,\nand the two streets whose names you have entered lie in different boroughs, then\nbefore pressing the Submit button or the ENTER key, but after selecting the Borough\nof First Street Name, you must select the Borough of Second Street Name. For example,\nthe Brooklyn street Ridgewood Avenue intersects with the Queens street Rockaway\nBoulevard at the Brooklyn-Queens border. To submit an Intersection (Function 2)\ninquiry for this location, select Brooklyn as the Borough of Street 1 or Intersection\nName, enter RIDGEWOOD AVE as the Street 1 or Intersection Name, select Queens as\nthe Borough of Street 2, and then enter ROCKAWAY BLVD as Street 2. (If you enter\nthe two street names in the other order, select the two boroughs accordingly.) Then\npress the Submit button or the ENTER key.\n\n\nSpecial case 2: If the streets you have entered intersect at two different points,\nyou must select a compass direction to identify which of the two intersections you\nare inquiring about. For example, to process the easternmost of the two intersections\nof Cromwell Crescent and Alderton Street in Queens, select EAST as the compass direction.\nIf you submit an inquiry for a pair of streets that intersect twice without having\nselected a compass direction, a message will inform you that a compass direction\nis required. If, on the other hand, you submit an inquiry for a pair of streets\nthat intersect once and you have selected a compass direction, you will in addition\nto the output receive a warning message indicating that the compass direction is\nnot required.\n\n\nSpecial case 3: Certain street intersections have intersection names. For example,\nthe intersection of West 54 Street and Broadway is known as \nBig Apple Corner\n.\nFor these special cases, you supply the intersection name in the field labeled Street\n1 or Intersection Name and leave the field labeled Street 2 blank. If the Street\n2 field is populated, GOAT will validate that the 2nd street does intersect at the\nnamed intersection. If yes, a warning message is returned (NON-INTERSECTION NAME\nIGNORED). However, if the name entered in the 2nd street field does not intersect\nat the named intersection the input is rejected (W 154 ST NOT PART OF BIG APPLE\nCORNER). Please note that \nTimes Square\n is not an intersection name,\nbecause it refers to an area which includes several intersections.\n\n\nThe pseudo-street names BEND, DEAD END and CITY LIMIT can be used as input street\nnames to specify bending points of streets, dead ends, and intersections of streets\nwith the city limit, respectively.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n  To submit a Function 2 inquiry for the bending point of Commerce Street in Manhattan,\n  enter COMMERCE STREET as one of the input street names and BEND as the other input\n  street name.\n\n\n  A dead end is a termination point of a street at which there are no cross streets.\n  For example, Croes Avenue in the Bronx has a dead end near where it intersects with\n  Watson Avenue. To submit a Function 2 inquiry for this dead end, enter CROES AVENUE\n  as one of the input street names and DEAD END as the other input street name.\n\n\n\n  Linden Boulevard in Queens intersects with the city limit (in this case, the Queens-Nassau\n  County border). To submit a Function 2 inquiry for this intersection, enter LINDEN\n  BOULEVARD as one of the input street names and CITY LIMIT as the other input street\n  name.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike ADDRESS (Function 1), INTERSECTION (Function 2) does not allow you to enter\na place name as input.\n\n\nReturn to Menu\n\n\n\n\nSTREET SEGMENT (Function 3) Help:\n\n\nSTREET SEGMENT (Function 3) accepts an input street segment (the portion of a street\nbetween two consecutive cross streets), and returns related geographic information.\nIf you are only interested in information for one side of the street segment (Block\nFace), you must supply a compass direction. The information returned includes administrative\nand political district identifiers for the left and/or right side of the segment\nand the names of any additional cross streets that are present at the two endpoints\nof the segment.\n\n\nInstructions for Entering Function 3 Input Data:\n\n\nSelect the Borough of the On Street Name. GOAT automatically modifies the Borough\nof First Cross Street and Second Cross Street to coincide with the Borough of the\nOn Street. Enter the names of the three streets, which define the segment. The first\nstreet name entered is the On Street and the next two represent one of the cross\nstreets at each end of the segment. Except for the special case discussed below,\nyou may now submit your inquiry by pressing the Submit button or the ENTER key.\n\n\nIf the segment you are submitting involves streets that are in two boroughs, then\nbefore pressing the Submit button or the ENTER key, you will have to modify the\nBorough information. If the street segment lies on a borough boundary and one or\nboth of the cross streets are in a different borough, then you will have to modify\nthe Borough for the First and/or Second Cross Street. An example of the situation\nwould be the street segment Eldert Lane in Queens with Cross Streets Etna Street\nand Ridgewood Avenue in Brooklyn. In this case, you would set the Borough for the\nOn Street to Queens and the Borough for the First and Second Cross Streets to Brooklyn.\nThen press the Submit button or the ENTER key.\n\n\nAnother possibility is that one of the Cross Streets lies in a different borough.\nAn example of this would be the street segment Ridgewood Avenue in Brooklyn with\nCross Streets 90 Avenue in Queens and Grant Avenue in Brooklyn. In this case, you\nwould set the Borough for the \nOn' Street to Brooklyn, the Borough for the\nFirst Cross Street to Queens and the Borough for the Second Cross Street to Brooklyn.\nThen press the Submit button or the ENTER key.\n\n\nThe pseudo-street names BEND, DEAD END and CITY LIMIT can be used as cross street\nnames when defining a segment. In addition CITY LIMIT may be used as an \nOn'\nStreet name in Queens and the Bronx.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n  To submit a Function 3 inquiry that includes the bending point of Commerce Street\n  in Manhattan, enter COMMERCE STREET as the \nOn' Street and BEND as one of\n  the cross street names and either BEDFORD STREET or BARROW STREET as the other cross\n  street name.\n\n\n  A dead end is a termination point of a street at which there are no cross streets.\n  For example, Croes Avenue in the Bronx has a dead end near where it intersects with\n  Watson Avenue. To submit a Function 3 inquiry that includes the dead end, enter\n  CROES AVENUE as the \nOn' street names and DEAD END as one of the other cross\n  street names and WATSON AVENUE as the other cross street name.\n\n\n\n  Linden Boulevard in Queens intersects with the city limit (in this case, the Queens-Nassau\n  County border). To submit a Function 3 inquiry that includes the city boundary,\n  enter LINDEN BOULEVARD as the On street name and CITY LIMIT as one of the cross\n  street names and X ISLE PARKWAY ENTRANCE NB as the other street name.\n\n\n\n  In Queens, CITY LIMIT may be specified as the On Street and 41 AVENUE and 41 DRIVE\n  may be specified as the cross street names. The information returned will be only\n  for the Queens side of the county border. No information will be returned for the\n  Nassau side of the county border.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlace names may not be used for either On street or Cross Street names in a STREET\nSEGMENT (Function 3) call.\n\n\nReturn to Menu\n\n\n\n\nSTREET STRETCH (Function 3S) Help:\n\n\nFunction 3S accepts as input a street stretch and returns the cross streets along\nthe stretch. You may supply an On Street alone or an On Street and two cross streets,\nwhich will limit the amount of data returned. If you elect to supply cross streets\nand if either or both cross streets intersect the On Street exactly twice, you must\nsupply a compass direction to determine which intersection you want selected. If\none or both of the cross streets intersect the On Street more than twice, an error\nmessage will be returned indicating this problem and no data will be returned. If,\non the other hand, you supply a compass direction and the On Street and cross street\nintersect once, in addition to the appropriate output, you will receive a warning\nmessage indicating that the compass direction was not required.\n\n\nInstructions for Entering STREET STRETCH (Function 3S) Input Data:\n\n\nAll streets supplied must be in the same borough.\n\n\nEnter the names of the On Street and, if you choose, the two cross streets as well\nas the relevant compass directions if either of the cross streets intersect the\nOn Street exactly twice. You may now submit your inquiry by pressing the Submit\nbutton or the ENTER key.\n\n\nThe pseudo-street names BEND and DEAD END cannot be used as the On Street in a Function\n3S call, but they may be used as cross street names when defining a segment. CITY\nLIMIT can be used as both an On Street and a cross street in Queens and the Bronx.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n\n  To submit a Function 3S inquiry that includes the bending point of Commerce Street\n  in Manhattan, enter COMMERCE STREET as the On Street and BEND as one of the cross\n  street names and either BEDFORD STREET or BARROW STREET as the other cross street\n  name. In general, using BEND as a cross street may be difficult because a street\n  stretch may have more than two bending points.\n\n\n\n  A dead end is a termination point of a street at which there are no cross streets.\n  For example, Croes Avenue in the Bronx has a dead end near where it intersects with\n  Watson Avenue. To submit a Function 3S inquiry that includes the dead end, enter\n  CROES AVENUE as the On Street name and DEAD END as one of the cross street names\n  and, say, STORY AVENUE as the other cross street name. Using DEAD END as a cross\n  street may be hard since a street stretch may have multiple dead ends.\n\n\n\n  Linden Boulevard in Queens intersects with the city limit (in this case, the Queens-Nassau\n  County border). To submit a Function 3S inquiry that includes the city boundary,\n  enter LINDEN BOULEVARD as the On Street name and CITY LIMIT as one of the cross\n  streets and, say, FRANCIS LEWIS BOULEVARD as the other cross street.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlace names may not be used for either \nOn' street or Cross Street names in\na Function 3S call.\n\n\nThere is also an option to \nShow Real Streets Only\n, which is set by\ndefault. This option returns the names of cross streets along a stretch, and will\nnot return items defined as \nNon-Street Feature\n or \nBend\n.\n\n\nReturn to Menu\n\n\n\n\nBLOCK \n LOT (Function BL) Help\n\n\nThe input data to BLOCK \n LOT (Function BL) is a Borough, Tax Block and Tax\nLot. The information returned is property -specific and building -specific.\n\n\nIn addition to the \nfixed' data returned, you have a choice of receiving a\nlist of up to twenty one addresses which applies to the property and/or a list of\nBINs (Building Identification Numbers) that reside on the property.\n\n\nThe TPAD (Transitional Property Address Directory) option allows you to get up-to-date\nproperty related information. The TPAD file is updated daily with new information\nreceived from the Department of Buildings regarding job filings for new buildings\nand demolition jobs. Information regarding activity and status is returned.\n\n\nInstructions for Entering BLOCK \n LOT (Function BL) Input Data:\n\n\nAs input data to Function BL, you must select a Borough, and enter the Tax Block\nand the Tax Lot numbers. The Tax Block is a five digit number and the Tax Lot is\na four digit number. Leading zeros need not be entered. If you select \nBIN\nList', you will receive a list of BINs as part of your output. If you do not select\n\nBIN List', you will receive a list of up to twenty one addresses which apply\nto the property. For some properties, there are more than twenty one addresses.\nIn these situations, in addition to the twenty one addresses, you will receive a\nwarning message indicating that the lot has more addresses than are displayed.\n\n\nReturn to Menu\n\n\n\n\nBIN (Function BN) Help:\n\n\nThe input data to Function BN is a Building Identification Number (BIN). The information\nreturned is building-specific and property-specific and represents information about\nthe single building.\n\n\nIn addition to the \nfixed' data returned, you will receive a list of addresses\nwhich applies to the input BIN. The list of addresses should be complete because\nat this time no single building has more than twenty one addresses.\n\n\nThe TPAD (Transitional Property Address Directory) option allows you to get up-to-date\nproperty related information. The TPAD file is updated daily with new information\nreceived from the Department of Buildings regarding job filings for new buildings\nand demolition jobs. Information regarding activity and status is returned.\n\n\nInstructions for Entering Function BN Input Data:\n\n\nAs input data to Function BN, you must enter the building identification number\nonly. The building identification number is seven digits in length. The first digit\nmust either be 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. The second digit must not be either an 8\n or a 9\n*.\nIf you are looking for a BIN that only exists in the TPAD file, then you must select\nthe TPAD option.\n\n\n*BINs with a second digit of 8 reference \ndummy\n BINs in the Department\nof Buildings BIS (Building Information System) and are not retrievable through GOAT.\n\n\n**BINs with a second digit of 9 refer to an obsolete BIN that was used to indicate\nmultiple structures. BINs with this numbering scheme are no longer assigned.\n\n\nReturn to Menu\n\n\n\n\nSTREET (Name / Code) Help:\n\n\nThis function allows for a variety of options. A user can enter a street name, a\nstreet code, browse the Street Name Dictionary (SND), or normalize a street name.\nThe term \nstreet name\n is used generically to encompass not only names\nof city streets, but also a wide variety of other New York City geographic feature\nnames including some tunnels, bridges, rail lines and place names. The terms \nstreet\nname\n and \ngeographic feature name\n are used interchangeably.\n\n\nThere are options to set the street name length, to choose Sort or Compact format,\nand normalize the input street name to return the primary, principal or preferred\nname. Output, depending on the options chosen, includes Borough, Street Name, Street\nCode and Geographic Feature Type.\n\n\nGeneral Instructions and Information regarding Street Name / Code:\n\n\nThe Department of City Planning maintains a set of names of geographic features\nthat Geosupport (the software behind GOAT) recognizes and considers valid. All of\nthese names are assigned Street Codes. Street codes enable street name aliases to\nbe grouped together in a meaningful way via the 5 digit or 7 digit street code.\nEach 10 digit street code is unique to a specific spelling variation of a street.\n\n\nIt is important to note that New York City geographic names are meaningful only\nwhen the borough is identified, since features in different boroughs can have the\nsame name. For example, all five boroughs have a street named BROADWAY.\n\n\nAll geographic feature names are stored in a standardized or \nnormalized\n\nformat, but the software will interpret data entered and \nnormalize\n\nit for the user. The normalizing algorithm is quite complex and is beyond the scope\nof this user guide, but some notable characteristics are as follows:\n\n\n\nOrdinal suffixes are absent. Ordinal suffixes are the endings \nst\n,\n\nnd\n, \nrd\n and \nth\n often used at the ends of\nnumeric street names such as \n71st\n, \n42nd\n, \n23rd\n,\nand 108th\n. \n\n\nStandard street endings are abbreviated (such as ST for Street, RD for Road, E for\nEast, etc.) only to the minimum extent necessary to enable names to fit within the\nStreet Name Length specified by the user. The minimum Street Name Length is 4 and\nthe maximum is 32. All geographic feature names in the system are normalized within\nthe 32 byte limit.\n\n\nThe character set used for names consists of the letters of the alphabet, the numeric\ndigits 0 through 9, and the characters dash ( - ), slash ( / ), ampersand ( \n\n) and apostrophe ( \n ). \n\n\n\n\nThe type of geographic feature associated with each name is identified by the geographic\nfeature type:\n\n\n\nThe names of New York City's streets (including highways), tunnels and bridges\n\n\nCertain pseudo-street names, including BEND, CITY LIMIT and DEAD END, and certain\nDuplicate Address Pseudo-Street names (DAPS\ns), such as HILLSIDE AVENUE DOUGLASTON\n\n\nThe names of certain non-street features, including some rail lines and shorelines\n\n\nSelected place names, of which there are three types:\n\n\n\n      \nAddressable place names\n are place names that can be combined with address\n          numbers to form addresses. Examples: the Manhattan names FEDERAL PLAZA and PENN\n          PLAZA. Examples of the use of these names in addresses:\n          \n\n          \n\n          26 FEDERAL PLAZA, 2 PENN PLAZA.\n\n          \n\n      \n\n      \nNon-Addressable Place names (NAPs)\n are place names that historically could\n          not be combined with address numbers to form addresses. Typical NAPs include the\n          names of islands, parks, airports, bodies of water, building complexes, major named\n          individual buildings etc. Examples: the Manhattan names EMPIRE STATE BUILDING and\n          CITY HALL, and the Queens name LA GUARDIA AIRPORT. Note that some NAPs (such as\n          EMPIRE STATE BUILDING) refer to buildings that also have conventional street addresses.\n          \n\n          \n\n          In recent years, addresses have been assigned to buildings that use the NAP name,\n          often in a different location from the NAP itself. An example in Manhattan is the\n          NAP called \nBryant Park\n. There is a building \nOne Bryant Park\n\n          which users typically enter as \n1 Bryant Park\n. Another example is a\n          NAP in Brooklyn called \nGrand Army Plaza\n. A cooperative now exists\n          nearby and its address is \n1 Grand Army Plaza\n.\n          \n\n          If a NAP name is entered into GOAT along with an address, the application will ignore\n          the house number if it does not exist in the underlying data.\n\n          \n\n      \n\n      \nIntersection Names\n are names given to the intersection of two or more streets\n          usually but not necessarily by the City Council. Intersection Names allow an intersection\n          to be identified using one input \nstreet\n name instead of two as is\n          currently required. BEN KIMMEL SQUARE in the Bronx is an example of an Intersection\n          Name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany geographic features have two or more aliases, or alternate names, or spelling\nvariants of the same name. One common case of aliases is names containing a numeric\nword between 1 and 10; these are all represented with two different spellings; with\nthe numeric word expressed in digits (such as 6 Avenue) and with the numeric word\nspelled out alphabetically (Sixth Avenue) and with the numeric word spelled\nout alphabetically (Sixth Avenue).\n\n\nThe following are examples of various types of aliases:\n\n\n\nSIXTH AVENUE and AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS are aliases, since they are alternative\nnames for the same street.\n\n\nSEVENTH AVENUE, FASHION AVENUE and ADAM POWELL JR BOULEVARD are aliases, since they\nare alternative names for the same street or (in the latter two cases) parts thereof.\n\n\nSIXTH AVENUE and 6 AVENUE are aliases, since they are spelling variants of the same\nstreet name. Other examples of spelling variant aliases are MAC DOUGAL STREET, MC\nDOUGAL STREET and MCDOUGAL STREET; BEN-GURION PLACE, BEN GURION PLACE and BENGURION\nPLACE; ST MARKS PLACE, SAINT MARKS PLACE and SAINT MARK\nS PLACE; and (in the\nBronx) O\nBRIEN AVENUE, OBRIEN AVENUE and O BRIEN AVENUE.\n\n\n\n\nThe existence of an alias relationship between two names stored in the system can\nbe readily identified from their street codes: \nTwo names are aliases if and only\nif the first six bytes of their B10SC\ns, known as the Borough-and-5-digit\nStreet Codes (B5SC\ns), are identical\n. It can also be readily determined\nwhether two aliases for a geographic feature are valid for the same part (possibly\nall) of the feature: \nTwo names are valid for the same part (possibly all) of a feature\nif and only if the first eight bytes of their B10SC\ns, known as the Borough-and-7-digit\nStreet Codes (B7SC\ns), are identical\n.\n\n\nFor example, SEVENTH AVENUE, 7 AVENUE, FASHION AVENUE and ADAM POWELL JR BOULEVARD\nin Manhattan are all aliases, so their street codes all have the same B5SC value.\nIn addition, SEVENTH AVENUE and 7 AVENUE are valid for the same part of the street\n(in this case, the entire street), so they have the same B7SC value. FASHION AVENUE\nis valid for a different part of the street (the portion in the Garment District\nof Midtown), so it has a different B7SC value. ADAM POWELL JR BOULEVARD is valid\nfor yet a different part of the street (the portion north of Central Park), so it\nhas yet a different B7SC value. In the case of a complex (such as Lincoln Center)\nand its constituent entities, the assignment of street codes is structured analogously\nto that just described for streets. The names of the entire complex and the names\nof its constituent entities are all treated as aliases of each other, since they\nare all names of the same geographic feature (the entire complex) or parts thereof\n(the constituent entities of the complex). \nBeing treated as aliases\n\nmeans that the B10SC\ns assigned to these names all have the same B5SC value.\nWithin the umbrella of this B5SC value, the entire complex has its own distinct\nB7SC value and each constituent entity has its own distinct B7SC value. For example,\nall of the names for Manhattan\ns Lincoln Center complex and its constituent\nentities have the same B5SC value. In addition, LINCOLN CENTER and LINCOLN CENTER\nFOR THE PFMG ARTS are alternative names of the same part of the complex (in this\ncase the entire complex), so these two names have the same B7SC value. AVERY FISHER\nHALL and PHILHARMONIC HALL are alternative names of the same part of the complex\n(in this case, a particular building), so these two names have the same B7SC value,\nwhich differs from the B7SC values assigned to the names of the entire complex and\nto the names of the complex\ns other constituent entities.\n\n\nUsers should also understand the difference between SORT and COMPACT Format. The\nsole difference between these two formats is the presence or absence of alignment\nblanks for names containing numeric characters. A conventional method of displaying\nstreets names is called the Compact Format because it does not contain leading blanks\nbefore numeric street names. The Sort Format is more suitable for listing street\nnames for display or in a report because street names will \nsort\n logically:\nnames will \nsort\n logically:\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \nSORTED LIST IN COMPACT FORMAT\n\n    \nSORTED LIST IN SORT FORMAT\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nEAST HOUSTON STREET\n\n    \nbbb\n5 AVENUE\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nEAST 1 STREET\n\n    \nbb\n10 AVENUE\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nEAST 10 STREET\n\n    \nEAST \nbbb\n1 STREET\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nEAST 102 STREET\n\n    \nEAST \nbbb\n2 STREET\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nEAST 129 STREET\n\n    \nEAST \nbbb\n3 STREET\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nEAST 13 STREET\n\n    \nEAST \nbbb\n9 STREET\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nEAST 167 STREET\n\n    \nEAST \nbb\n10 STREET\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nEAST 2 STREET\n\n    \nEAST \nbb\n13 STREET\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nEAST 20 STREET\n\n    \nEAST \nbb\n20 STREET\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nEAST 201 STREET\n\n    \nEAST \nbb\n79 STREET\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nEAST 3 STREET\n\n    \nEAST \nb\n102 STREET\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nEAST 79 STREET\n\n    \nEAST \nb\n129 STREET\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \nEAST 9 STREET\n\n    \nEAST \nb\n167 STREET\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n  \nFULTON STREET\n\n  \nEAST \nb\n201 STREET\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n  \n10 AVENUE\n\n  \nEAST HOUSTON STREET\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \n5 AVENUE\n\n    \nFULTON STREET\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs this example illustrates, in the compact format, normalized street names do not\nsort appropriately. For example, EAST 10 STREET sorts in front of EAST 9 STREET,\nand 10 AVENUE sorts in front of 5 AVENUE. In contrast, in the sort format, the presence\nof the alignment blanks causes street names containing numeric characters to sort\nappropriately. Notice that the presence of the alignment blanks in the sort format\n(shown as \nb\n in the example), and their absence in\nthe compact format, causes a change to the sort order of numeric street names not\nonly relative to each other, but also relative to non-numeric street names. For\nexample, in the compact format, FULTON STREET sorts in front of street names that\nbegin with a numeric character, such as 10 AVENUE, while in the sort format it sorts\nbehind them. Similarly, in the compact format, EAST HOUSTON STREET sorts in front\nof the street names that start with the word EAST followed by a numeric word, while\nin the sort format, it sorts behind those street names.\n\n\nFor more information regarding street names and street codes, please refer to our\n\nUser Programming Guide (Chapters III and IV)\n.\n\n\nInstructions for Entering STREET (Name / Code) data:\n\n\nThe STREET (Name / Code) tab in the GOAT application offers a variety of options:\n\n\n\nConvert Street Name to Street Code: Select a Borough from the dropdown list and\nenter a street name. You have the additional options of selecting a Street Name\nLength between 4 and 32 (the default is 32), or specifying Sort vs. Compact Format\n(the default is Sort). Hit the Submit button. The information returned is the Street\nName in normalized format, the Borough 10 digit street code (B10SC) and the Geographic\nFeature Type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConvert Street Code to Street Name (D, DG, DN): Enter up to 3 street codes (B5SC,\nB7SC or B10SC). You have the additional options of selecting a Street Name Length\nbetween 4 and 32 (the default is 32), or specifying Sort vs. Compact Format (the\ndefault is Sort). Hit the Submit button. The information returned is the Borough,\nthe Street Name in normalized format, the Borough 10 digit street code (B10SC) and\nthe Geographic Feature Type.\n\n\n\nNote that if you choose to enter up to 3 street codes, they all must be the same\nformat; you must enter either all B5SCs, allB7SCs or all B10SCs. If you enter an\noptional second or third street code, the software expects those to be in the same\nformat that you entered the first street code. Therefore, if you enter a B5SC in\nthe first field and a B7SC in the second field, GOAT will ignore the last two digits\nsupplied in the B7SC. If on the other hand you enter a B7SC in the first field and\na B5SC in the second or third field, GOAT will treat this as an error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalize Input Street Name (N*): Enter up to 3 street names that are not necessarily\nrecognized by the system (i.e. either do not exist or have not been assigned street\ncodes). You have the additional options of selecting a Street Name Length between\n4 and 32 (the default is 32), or specifying Sort vs. Compact Format (the default\nis Sort). Hit the Submit button. The information returned is the street name(s)\nin normalized format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowse Street Name Dictionary (BB, BF): Select a borough from the dropdown list\nand enter a street name. You have the additional option to normalize the input street\nname as the input street, the primary street name (as per the B5SC), the principal\nstreet name (as per the B7SC) or the preferred street name. Hit the Submit button.\nPlease note that there is no Sort vs. Compact option available in this function.\nThe output will always be in sort format.\n\n\nReturn to Menu",
