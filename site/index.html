<h2><b>WebGBAT Glossary</b></h2>

<p>This is the Glossary Page for WebGBAT &#8211; It
contains definitions for the fields displayed for the various function calls
available in WebGBAT. A list of expected field values and their meaning accompanies
the definitions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="add_valid"></a><strong>Additional Valid B7SC/Street Name:</strong></p>
<p>Identifies additional local group of street names at the given location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="addr_id"></a><strong>Address Point ID:</strong></p>
<p>The Address Point ID is a unique nine digit identifier for each address point.
Address Points are items in a CSCL feature class that represent point locations
(approximately five feet inside a building (identified by BIN)) along the
corresponding street frontage. Initially these were based on DCP&#8217;s Property
Address Directory (PAD). Please note that whereas addresses in PAD reflect an
administrative address range for a building, the Address Points usually only
reflect the posted address. For example, PAD shows 14 &#8211; 32 Reade Street as the
address for DCP&#8217;s former headquarters. The Address Point only shows 22 &#8211; 22
Reade Street (the posted address).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="add_range"></a><strong>Address Range List:</strong></p>
<p>An input address number is often part of a larger address range that is valid
for a tax lot. A location may also have additional address ranges on street
names that differ from the input, particularly when the input address is located
on a corner lot or a through lot. The address range list includes the Address
Type, Low and High Address Numbers, Street Name, BIN and TPAD BIN Status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="addr_type"></a><strong>Address Type:</strong></p>
<p>Various geographic identifiers related to the property functions in Geosupport
(1B, BL, BN).</p>

<p>New York State Assembly District. A district of the lower house of the New York
State legislature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="ap"></a><strong>Atomic Polygon (formerly called Dynamic Block):</strong></p>
<p>A minimal polygon formed by most segments in the underlying data. 'Minimal'
means the polygon is not subdivided by other segments into a smaller polygon.
Atomic Polygon numbers are unique within 2010 Census Tracts and are used as
building blocks for many higher geographies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="auxseg_count"></a><strong>Auxiliary Segment Count:</strong></p>

<p>List of Segment ID's associated with a generated record.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="b7sc"></a><strong>B5SC, B7SC, B10SC (Street Codes):</strong></p>
<p>Numeric street codes are assigned to represent the city&#8217;s street names and other
geographic feature names. A borough code combined with a 5-digit street code
(B5SC) corresponds to the primary name for a given piece of geography and
encodes the alias relationships between street names. A borough code combined
with a 7-digit street code (B7SC) corresponds to the preferred name for a
specific location on a street whereas a 10-digit street code (B10SC) corresponds
to a specific spelling of a specific street name in the given borough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="bbl"></a><strong>BBL (Borough, Block, Lot):</strong></p>
<p>Identifies a parcel of real property in New York City, called a tax lot. The BBL
contains a 1 byte Borough Code, a 5-byte Tax Block, and a 4-byte tax lot. The
tax block and tax lot are both right justified, zero filled.</p>
<p>In a condominium, each condominium unit is a separate tax lot and has its own
BBL. WebGBAT will return both the low and high BBL associated with the condo. Users
should also note than if a condo lot is entered as input into a Block &amp; Lot
(Function BL), the tax lot returned in WebGBAT is a Billing BBL, generally
associated with the management company for the condo instead of an individual
owner.</p>

<p><a name="bin"></a><strong>BIN:</strong></p>
<p>Building Identification Number (BIN) is a seven-digit numerical identifier
unique to each building in the City of New York. The first digit is the Borough
Code. If the borough code is followed by all zeroes (commonly referred to as a
&#8216;million BIN&#8217;, this indicates that a BIN has not been assigned, either because
the address associated with the building has not yet been built, an address is
assigned as a potential valid range where there is no building (vacant lot or
vacant street frontage), or it is associated with a constituent entity of a
Complex NAP but does not indicate a building or structure that would have a BIN
assignment (such as the Children&#8217;s Zoo Spider Web within Central Park).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BIN Status:</strong> See <a href=".#tpad_conflict_flag">TPAD BIN Status</a></p>

<p><a name="block_face"></a><strong>Block Face:</strong></p>
<p>A block face is generally described as one side of a street between two
consecutive intersections, or one side a city block. This field returns the
number of block faces that border the tax lot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="block_face_id"></a><strong>Block Face ID:</strong></p>
<p>Left Blockface ID is a ten digit number identifying the block face on the left
hand side of a segment. Correspondingly, Right Blockface ID identifies the block
face on the right hand side of a segment. Block Face is defined as one
continuous side of a physical block that is intersected on that side by two
other physical through streets. Blockface IDs were established by DoITT&#8217;s
consultants working on the planimetric feature classes for NYC and are not
maintained by the Department of City Planning.</p>

<p>This flag indicates whether the given geographic feature segment is in reality
curved. If so, the curve may be an arc of a circle or an irregular curve. When
the segment specified by the input data is an arc of a circle, Functions 1 and
1E return Spatial Coordinates that are positioned relative to this arc rather
than to the segment&#8217;s chord (the imaginary straight line joining the curved
feature&#8217;s endpoints). When the segment specified by the input data is an
irregular curve, Functions 1 and 1E return blanks in the Spatial Coordinate
fields (q.v.), and issue a warning with Reason Code value &#8216;P&#8217;. In the case of
Functions 3 and 3C, if the input data define a street stretch encompassing more
than one segment (because of a T-intersection or bend), the Curve Flag is set
&#8216;on&#8217; (non-blank) if at least one of the constituent segments of the stretch is
curved. See also discussion of Segment Length.</p>

<a name="stname"></a><strong>Street Name:</strong>


The Street or non-street feature name for a given location. WebGBAT normalizes street
names so that users have considerable leeway in data entry. For example, WebGBAT allows
many commonly used abbreviations for street endings and &#8216;normalizes&#8217;
the name to the one stored in the software. Users have a choice of two formats for
normalizing street names, called the compact and sort formats. The sort format includes
spacing to allow the proper sorting of numerical street names for reporting purposes,
and compact removes the spaces. A more complete explanation regarding street names
and their associated street codes is beyond the scope of this document. For more
information, please refer to Chapters III and IV of the <a href="/upg.pdf#page=31" target="\_blank">User Programming Guide</a>.

<a name="USPS_city_name"></a><strong>USPS Preferred City Name:</strong>

The USPS (United States Postal Service) Preferred City Name (.e.g. Astoria, Jackson
Heights) is based on the ZIP code associated with the input address, and of
particular importance for Queens addresses.&nbsp; Unless there is a special ZIP code,
the following holds true for the other boroughs:  For Manhattan, the USPS Preferred
City Name is New York; for all other boroughs the USPS Preferred City Name is the
borough name, viz. Bronx, Brooklyn, and Staten Island.

<br>

<br><a name="vacant_flag"></a><strong>Vacant Lot:</strong>

Indicates whether or not a tax lot is vacant

<br>

<br><a name="x_coord"></a><strong>X,Y Coordinate:</strong>

Spatial coordinates (New York Long Island State Plane). Spatial coordinates are a pair of numbers
that specify a location on the earth’s surface. The X, Y location returned in the
geographic information section of an Address (Function 1B) call are imprecise and
based on an algorithm that approximates the location based on the address range.
In the property level information of an address call, the X, Y coordinate is an
internal centroid derived from the tax lot. This same property level X, Y is returned
in a Block & Lot (Function BL) and BIN (Function BN) call. The X, Y returned in
an Intersection (Function 2) call corresponds to the node at that location.
WebGBAT also returns X, Y coordinates for the 'From Node' or end of the street segment
and for the 'To Node' or end of the street segment.
